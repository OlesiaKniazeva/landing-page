 Simple landing page to practice CSS/HTML and flexbox usage.

Made as a part of learning process in The Odin Project:
[The Odin Project foundations - Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page#solutions).

Generally, landing page should look like this. I repeated the structure similarly, but also added some customization to my page.

The result is here:  [Landing Page](olesiakniazeva.github.io/landing-page/)
